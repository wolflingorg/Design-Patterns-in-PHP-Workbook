# Solution # 1

### Singleton pattern

Since we can have only one instance of Application, why not use Singleton design pattern.

### Decorator pattern

Decorator pattern allows us to attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. We can use it in order to append caching.

### Strategy pattern

Since our application can have more than one cache strategy, Strategy design pattern is the best candidate to use.
