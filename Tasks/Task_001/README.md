# Task # 1

### Quick access to the parameters of JPG file

Create the class that allows getting the size of JPG file with the following assumption: if the file name ends with **_W_H.jpg** (where **W** and **H** are integers) than **W** is image's width and **H** is image's height. In this case, you can use these parameters without opening a file. Otherwise, you should open a file and calculate image's width and height using some graphic library (can be more than one).
